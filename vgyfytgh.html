<h1 style="color:red;text-align:left">There are two types of Unemployment:-</h1><br>
<h2 style="color:purple;text-align:left"><u>1.Disguised Unemployment:</u></h2>
<h3 style="color:green;text-align:left"><i>Disguised Unemployment is a kind of unemployment in which there are people who are visibly employed but are actually unemployed. This situation is also known as Hidden Unemployment. In such a situation more people are engaged in a work than required.<br><br>
Foe Example=If a piece of land requires only three people to work on it and instead five people are working on it, then the two extra people are said to be in a situation of disguised unemployment.
</i></h3><br><br>
<h2 style="color:purple;text-align:left"><u>2.Seasonal Unemployment:</u></h2>
<h3  style="color:green;text-align:left"><i>Seasonal unemployment occurs when people are unemployed at particular times of the year when demand for labour is lower than usual. Since only a few workers are needed, it results in unemployment.<br><br>
For example= in agriculture, the sowing and harvesting periods require labour, but during the rest of the year, the landless labour may remain out of work.
